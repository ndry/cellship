This is playable proof of concept.
It utilizes 1d cellular automata trying to achieve elementary emergent gameplay.
It consumes automaton's table as `code` get-parameter. Best used with [ca-analyzer-web](https://ndry.github.io/ca-analyzer-web/public/) ([repo](https://github.com/ndry/ca-analyzer-web)) -- web application for quick preview of 1d cellular automata.
